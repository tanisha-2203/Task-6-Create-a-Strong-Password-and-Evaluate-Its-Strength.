# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength.

A *strong password* is hard for hackers to guess. It usually includes:
1. Uppercase letters (A–Z)
2. Lowercase letters (a–z)
3. Numbers (0–9)
4. Symbols (! @ # \$ % ^ & \*)
5. Is at least 12 characters long
6. Doesn’t use personal info like your name or birthdate

Evaluation:
tanisha123       | 30%   Too short, lacks symbols & uppercase
Tanisha\@123     | 55%   Better, but still predictable       
T\@n!ShA#2025    | 80%   Strong, good use of symbols and mix  
B7p\$g!wZ\@3#xLq | 100%  Very strong, random and long         



Learnings:
I found out that good passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a combination of letters, digits, and special characters. Don't use your personal details or common words. Long and complicated passwords will protect you from brute-force and dictionary attacks.

To remain secure, I will employ the use of a password manager and never reuse a password on more than one site.
